# Filter_matlab

The script calculates the necessary filter order ($n$) and cutoff frequency ($wn$) based on specific performance requirements (passband ripple and stopband attenuation), visualizes the frequency response, and provides the digital coefficients.Low-Pass Butterworth Filter DesignerThis MATLAB script automates the process of designing an analog Butterworth low-pass filter and converting it to its digital equivalent.🛠 FeaturesAutomatic Order Selection: Calculates the minimum filter order $(n)$ required to meet ripple and attenuation specs.Analog Filter Design: Generates transfer function coefficients $(b, a)$ for the analog domain.Visualization: Plots the frequency response (Magnitude in dB vs. Frequency).Digital Conversion: Uses the Bilinear Transformation method to map the analog filter into a digital filter.📊 Filter ParametersThe script uses the following design specifications:ParameterValueDescriptionrp0.3 dBPassband Ripplers60 dBStopband Attenuation (Stopband Ripple)wp1000 HzPassband Edge Frequencyws2000 HzStopband Edge Frequencyfs9000 HzSampling Frequency🚀 How It WorksFrequency Normalization: It normalizes the frequencies relative to the sampling frequency.Order Calculation: Uses buttord to find the lowest order $n$ that satisfies the loss requirements.Coefficient Generation: Uses butter to create the transfer function.Frequency Analysis: Uses freqz to compute the response, which is then plotted on a logarithmic (dB) scale.Bilinear Transformation: Converts the analog $s$-domain transfer function into a digital $z$-domain transfer function.
